                <p class="p">Health Minister T Harish Rao on Thursday registered his protest against the Centre for hiking the prices of lifesaving drugs by 12%. In a statement here, Harish Rao said that the price hike was nothing but depriving the poor of medical facilities. He said that prices of medicines for fever, infections, BP, skin diseases and anaemia have been hiked.“Besides, prices of antibiotics, painkillers and others too have increased. It would become a burden for the middle and lower middle class people, as the Centre increased the prices of over 800 medicines,” the minister said. </p>
